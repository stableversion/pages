Oh to walk on empty midnight streets, wondering about life and how much of an idiot you’ve been the whole time, or maybe just getting the visual pleasure and calmness of the scenery.

To receive the constant rapid-fire of information and artificial stimuli that you can’t take the time to actually think through, or just breathe out. Instead, mindlessly consuming, only getting a feeling of understanding, without actually understanding. Only getting a feeling of comfort, without actually being comfortable

To walk on thick white snow In the cold and daunting fog, but strangely, finding calmness. As if the world has stopped, and you have all the time to find the truth.

To find the truth that doesn’t matter, swing too much, and your back at the start.
