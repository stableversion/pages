This number was slowly creeping in on me. Every time I saved, I watched it rise. I don't know how to feel about it. Have I failed because I never released them? Or did I succeed because I saved myself from embarrassment and "going out of style?" I don't know.

But looking at that number made me question why I even make music in the first place. "What's the point of music if you can't even share it?" Isn't that the whole point of music, in self-expression?

So I figured why not share **some** things that will probably never see the light of day anyway, and will just sit on my harddrive forever. All of them were made in 2020, which is actually quite a while ago now. It's almost 2022.

It's fascinating to look back at the genres I used to make; they are so different now. They brough back many memories, and were made at a time where music felt childlike to me.

It's also weird to realise that almost all of my music stemmed from Plastis Memories. That's the only reason it didn't have its own category. It was basically the backbone of everything.

Anyway, I hope you dont find them too cringy, enjoy.

**Note: Song dates indicate the last saved version, the creation time is likely *much, much* earlier. Also, bitrate decreased to save space, sorry!**

I am yumemi hoshino. Thank you for such a beautiful name.

As I am a cheap model, I cannot shed tears ... But if I was equipped with that function ... I think I would be crying now. 

I will look after the planetarium. I will make sure i am careful. Please enjoy your journey everybody.

Tonight there is a special secret we are going to share with you. The planetarium is also a time machine. It can manipulate time to take you from the distant past to the undiscovered future.

Please remember this, everybody. In the world of stars, one does not long for something unattainable, because even when life is mundane ... Please remember the stars that you have seen here.

## Serial Experiments Lain

![img](lainwired.avif)

No matter where you go, everybody's connected.

The program that inserted codes synced to the Earth's characteristic frequency into the corresponding Protocol 7 code ultimately raised the collective unconscious to the conscious level. So tell me: Did you honestly come up with all these ideas by yourself?

Why are you crying, Lain? Because you deleted yourself from everyone's memory? But, Lain, isn't that what you wanted all along?
