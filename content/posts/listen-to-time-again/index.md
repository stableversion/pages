> EVEN NOW> i LOOK AT a DREAm

*Listen To Time Again was the first M@D I fell in love with. Both for its incredible visuals and the feeling of "eternity". I still remember the first time I saw this. It was intense. The lights flashing, the music singing. I suddenly felt things I had never felt before.*

*It can be dificult describing those feelings, and the affects of it are a little bit emberassing to me, but this is my attempt.*

*if you found this via google search, please [share](https://www.aira.vision/contact/) with me your experience!*

## What is MAD?

MAD or M@D, is shorted for "music anime douga"

MAD can be used to describe the the Japanese underground media community. However, MADs can be mush-ups of anything from audio clips, edited pictures, to wholly originally created content (e.g. custom animation). While not all MADs are associated anime or manga, most of the more popular ones typically are.

AMVs on the other hand typically describe the American media subculture of editing bits of anime with music, though similar in content the scope tends to differ.

## Background 

The short M@D video for Saishuu Heiki Kanojo is a work on the theme of love and time, but it's more comprehensive in its graphics than its philosophical content, as M@D's tend to do the latter. The music video turned out to be absolutly beatiful for its time, to the point where it's hard to believe it was made in 2005, with such limited graphics capabilities. 

The thing that kept standing out to me was the poor knowledge of English, which is quite peculiar to the vast majority of Japanese authors. You know, I think you can forgive the Japanese for not paying too much attention to their pronunciation and spelling ;)

This clip was awarded the best Seishigа (still picture) M@D 2005 in Japan. (Seishiga M@D grand prize 2005 that you choose)

## Complementary

As said earlier, this M@D is based on an anime called Saishuu Heiki Kanojo (She, The Ultimate Weapon), and it would not feel the same without it. Although, I cant reccomend it in good faith if your dont know what your getting into. It was very painful, the bad kind of pain where you have no tears, especially if you have a tendency to completely engulf yourself in their personality, role, and feelings. And not that it was particularly well written or had any sort of strong philosophy going for it, but still...

Eternity does not feel the same.

## Song 

> kors k ［Remixed by Sota Fujimori］- Love Is Eternity ～SF SYNTH TRANCE MIX～ 

No matter how many times I listened to it, it never got old, and still gives me the same feeling it did two years ago. It allowed me to dream again, and make countless stories in my head. And if you ever wonder why my creations always have some cringy backstory or explanation to them, that's why.

```
kors k

It was intense.

I actually got the idea to make this song during 9th style, and after making it, received a request to make a remix for the song in 

10th style. I was going to do it but instead decided to put the original song on 10th.

The piano part of the song was inspired by dj TAKA.

I produced the whole song myself, along with 10 other people advising me. Many of them had trouble playing this song the first time.

T. Kally provided her bewitching voice for the song, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank her.

Music provides a voice for me even though the effect may be a bit embarrassing to me. (ashamed)

## Y2K Aesthetic

This M@D introduced me to the Y2K aesthetic, and it was truly love at first sight. I was immediately captivated by the high contrast, blue dreamy feelings, and limitations of early graphics. It was often accompanied by "corny text", with some grammatical errors, usually from those who didn't know English very well, but they tried, and you felt it.

Its one of the many reasons I adore this style -- its pure sincerity. It's not afraid of showing emotion and doesn't try to be someone else. Intsead, it unites all in hopes and dreams of a better technological future.

But it would not be complete without, arguably, the most important part -- the audio experience. There's just something special about these euthoric melodies, manifesting the boundlessness of the infite sky. The feeling, which has been greatly lost to time. There aren't many things trying to convey it anymore, and I guess that's what makes it special.
