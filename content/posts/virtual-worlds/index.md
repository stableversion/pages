All Worlds Made By [Yayoichan.](https://en.vrcw.net/world/author/detail/%E7%8C%AB%E5%B1%8B%E6%95%B7%E3%82%84%E3%82%88%E3%81%84) (猫屋敷やよい)

I often get lost in these worlds. There's one thing of seeing it on screen, but another of actually feeling like being there.

One of my favorite things to do is to invite other people into these worlds and listen to what kinds of feelings and associations they have with it, and it always tends to be different from anyone else. This is also the reason I like music, there’s one way a creator imagined it, but another way of how the listener/viewer interpreted it, and what associations they have with it.

It also feels as if those dreamy worlds incentivize thoughts, I have lost count of the number of times we've had genuine conversations about various topics from VR's future, to political ideologies, but strangely, we weren't arguing, but rather trying to understand. 

As if the person has changed.

I wish I was a physiatrist to explain things, but Yayoichan seemed to crack the code for being. [We love nature,](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/how-does-nature-impact-our-wellbeing) (even if [it's virtual,)](https://www.verywellmind.com/virtual-reality-experiences-may-have-mood-boosting-benefits-5088684) we [love good colors,](https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-2795824) and we strive connection. There's a reason we use these in therapy.

It heals people.

I sincerely hope this future won't be lost to data mining companies.
