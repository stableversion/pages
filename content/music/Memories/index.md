This started out as a mistake, as I accidentally duplicated triplets and replaced the half. That's where the melody came from. This melody gave me fast-paced footage in the dark with a slight grain effect and camera shake with different points of life passing by. That’s where the name comes from. This happens to be my first rock/alternative song I wrote and published, and since I couldn't fit this style with any of my other music accounts, I created a new one.

As to why I made a guitar song in the first place, well, it simply gives the feelings that could not be achieved with other genres, but ironically, I could not convey exactly what I wanted to, as with all the other things I make... 

> But I’ve promised myself that I will release stuff, even if it's not "up to my standards"—because my standards are unataiable.

And yet, I really didn't want to publish this; it did not feel right, it felt like I could do better..

It’s a shame I lost all feelings for this song, but like always, will get them back once I completely forget about its existence. It feels wasteful to use such a "powerful" title as "Memories" for something I'm not so proud of, nor something that expresses myself properly. Maybe I'm just going too hard on myself, oh well.

It's weird how this song in itself will be a memory to me, and I will forever remember the feelings from writing this, and the things I didnt include -- deemed too cringy and personal.

## Technical

This song, or more specifically, GUITAR RIG 6, completely destroyed my computer. I cannot describe how stuttery it was. I had to render the whole track every time i wanted to do any mastering on it, and mixing was literally hell. It completely ruined the fun for me. Oh wait, did I mention I use Bitwig with Yabridge now?

yeye, im officially a ***arch*** linux pro-audio'er now. There's like, 2 of us.

Working on this track made me realize multiple things:
- DONT BLINDLY COMPRESS
- CHECK YOUR INSTRUMENT FOR REVERB/DELAY BEFORE ADDING ANY EFFECTS TO IT!!!!!! 
- Smart:EQ3 will solve your depression 
- Saturation is VERY important
- When in doubt, use presets
- I cannot make anything chill
- Use cymbals wisely, otherwise your high's sound like styrofoam
- A song is never finished, only abandoned
- I have permanent hearing loss

I would also like to mention [White Sea Studio](https://www.youtube.com/c/Whiteseastudio) and [Dan Worrall.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQnz5mUTDkGwKvIQ9uyqiXw) They really helped me out on my mixing and mastering game, I am forever gratefull to them.
