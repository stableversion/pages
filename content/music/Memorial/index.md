I didn't actually make a post about this until now? I thought maybe it was going to be one of those mysterious accounts with no explanation, but maybe not so much. It's not like it's going to be famous or anything; it's just a passionate side-project.

## Memorial

This is probably the most divergent song that will ever be on this account. But since I have no other place to put it, it will live here, as a memorial :)

It actually only took me 3 days to make, which is insane considering how long it takes me to publish... anything. It was such a huge sweep of sudden inspiration that it felt like the whole world literally came together for this to happen.

And the end result turned out to be quite emotive.
