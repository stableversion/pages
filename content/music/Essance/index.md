This one was a weird one. Usually I'm inspired by some sort of melody or sound-type that I listen to, but this was just me opening up Ableton and starting to make something -- and that never happens. Maybe this is why it took me so long to finish, because I just didn't have any associations while making it. <abbr title="Maybe I appeared somewhere else, ahaha">This also happens to be the first track I released in a year.</abbr> Also my first track to be made entirely on Linux ;) I use arch btw. I'll write a post about that eventually.

The name is pretty self explanatory, essence just means:
```
: the basic nature of a thing : the quality or qualities that make a thing what it is
```

But I can't quite grasp what made me choose that name. Maybe it's the beginning of something.

Also... Damn is mastering acid hard! Even my "mastered version" sounds messy in the mids, but I just don't know how to fix that, and even if I try to fix it, now the drums are getting phased. Fix the drums, now the strings are phased...
